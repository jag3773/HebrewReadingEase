The Hebrew Reading Ease is a scale based on word frequencyfor biblical Hebrew.
The script iterates through the Hebrew Bible and generates a frequency index
of each word that occurs.  Then, the script works back through the text and
generates two difficulty averages for each passage.

The script will rate the whole Hebrew Bible and output a file called hre.txt
that contains the averages for each verse, chapter, and book.

The script relies on the xml files of the Open Scriptures MorphHB project found
here: http://github.com/openscriptures/morphhb.
